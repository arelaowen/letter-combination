# letter-combination

This project demonstrates the core logic behind generating **all possible letter combinations** from a given dataset of digits mapped to letters (similar to a phone keypad).
The main goal of this project is to emphasize **algorithmic thinking and combination logic**, not UI or framework complexity.

## Dataset Mapping

Each number maps to a set of characters:
1: '   ',
2: 'abc',
3: 'def',
4: 'ghi',
5: 'jkl',
6: 'mno',
7: 'pqrs',
8: 'tuv',
9: 'wxyz'

## What It Does

Given a sequence of digits, the program:
- Looks up the corresponding letters for each digit
- Generates **all possible combinations** using those letters
- Outputs the complete list of combinations

### Example

Input: 23
Output: ad, ae, af, bd, be, bf, cd, ce, cf

## Purpose

- Practice recursion / iteration
- Understand Cartesian products
- Improve problem-solving and logic-building skills
- Common interview-style problem

## Tech Stack

- **Vue.js 2**
- **Vuetify**
- JavaScript
